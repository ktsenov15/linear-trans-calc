# Vector-Matrix Calculator User Guide
## 1.	Loading Linear Transformations
Before running the program, you might want to manually add linear transformations other than the standard transformations already imported into the calculator. To do this, you can go to the project solution folder and open the text file “TransMatrixInput.txt”. Then, following the example of previous entries, enter a new matrix. On the first line, enter the dimension of matrices your matrix is meant to transform (“2D” or “3D”) and the dimension of your matrix (an integer between 2 and 4). On the next line, write a name for your transformation. Finally, enter the elements of your matrix.
Transformation matrices have arguments which are set at runtime. In case your matrix is a rotation matrix, you can set some elements to positive or negative “sin(x)” / “cos(x)”. Notice that the name of your transformation must contain the word “rotation” in order for the program to recognize it as such. Otherwise, you can set the argument elements to “x”, “y”, and “z” which correspond to each of the axes respectively. Note, that you can write any letter as many times as you wish but the program won’t recognize any other letters and will only recognize “z” if the matrix is a 3D transformation.
## 2.	Performing Calculations
Now, that the transformations are loaded, we shall proceed with the operations you can perform upon running the calculator. There are three types of operations you can select: matrix arithmetic operations, vector arithmetic operations, and vector-matrix multiplications. The following three sections discuss each one of those respectively.
### 2.1.	Matrix Arithmetic Operations
If you select matrix arithmetic operations, you have to enter the dimension of the matrices (2 or 3), the elements of each matrix, and afterwards select an operation – addition, subtraction, or multiplication. The program then displays both what your input looks like and the result from the operation.
### 2.2.	Vector Arithmetic Operations
If you select vector arithmetic operations, you have to enter the dimension of the vectors (2 or 3), the elements of each vector, and select an operation – addition, subtraction, dot product, or cross product. The program then displays both what your input looks like and the result from the operation.
### 2.3.	Vector-Matrix Multiplication
If you select vector-matrix multiplication, you have to enter the dimension of the vector to be transformed (2 or 3), the elements of the vector, and select an operation – standard multiplication or a pre-defined linear transformation. If you choose standard multiplication, you have to insert the elements of your matrix. If you choose a linear transformation, the program will display a menu with the names of transformations from the input file that correspond to your vector’s dimension. You have to choose an operation, set the arguments of the transformation matrix (angle or coefficients). The program then displays both what your input looks like and the result from the operation.
## 3.	Further details
At certain steps of the calculation process, you will also be given the chance to enter “R” to restart the calculator, and “X” to exit the program. Please, note that only capital letters will execute the specified actions – any invalid input will cause the program to repeatedly request valid input.
