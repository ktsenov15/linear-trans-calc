# Linear Transformation Calculator
A console application in C++ that performs arithmetic operations with 2D/3D vectors and matrices. The calculator has extra functionality to perform classical linear transformations on vectors (rotation, translation, and scaling, as more can be added to the transformation collection in the input text file).

This project is a final course project for the Fundamental Data Structures course which is part of my Computer Science studies.
